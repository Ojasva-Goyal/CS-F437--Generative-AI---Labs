- [Lab 2:  Neural Networks (with Python)](Lab_2)
- [Lab 3: Text generation with Logistic regression & RNNs.](Lab_3)
- [Lab 4:  Image generation](Lab_4)
- [Lab 5: Pixel RNNs](Lab_5)
- [Lab 6: Pixel CNNs and Autoencoders](Lab_6)
- [Lab 7: Variational AutoEncoders (VAEs)](Lab_7)
- [Lab 8: TRANSFORMERS](Lab_8)
- [Lab 9: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)](Lab_9)
- [Lab 10: Image Generation using Diffusion Models](Lab_10)

## Setup Instructions

To run the solutions on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ojasva-Goyal/CS-F437--Generative-AI---Labs.git
   ```
   ``` bash
   cd CS-F437--Generative-AI---Labs
   ```
2. Install necessary dependencies. It's recommended to use a virtual environment:
   ``` bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```
   ```bash
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```
3. Navigate to the respective lab directory and open the Jupyter notebook:
   ```bash
   cd Lab_<Lab_No>
   ```
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook <solution_file_name>.ipynb
   ```
  Note: Ensure you have Jupyter installed. If not, you can install it via pip:
  ```bash
  pip install jupyter
  ```
