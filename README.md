## Setup Instructions

To run the solutions on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ojasva-Goyal/CS-F437--Generative-AI---Labs.git
   ```
   ``` bash
   cd CS-F437--Generative-AI---Labs
   ```
2. Install necessary dependencies. It's recommended to use a virtual environment:
   ``` bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```
   ```bash
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```
3. Navigate to the respective lab directory and open the Jupyter notebook:
   ```bash
   cd Lab_<Lab_No>
   ```
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook <solution_file_name>.ipynb
   ```
  Note: Ensure you have Jupyter installed. If not, you can install it via pip:
  ```bash
  pip install jupyter
  ```
